# Vigilate
Tiny service to prevent a PC from locking.
This runs happily in the background and uses a system call to prevent the PC locking, there are no keys pressed or visible interference to the user and resource usage will be tiny.

UI provided, accessible from the taskbar to start and stop the application. When the application launches, it does not by default start the thread keeping the PC awake.
